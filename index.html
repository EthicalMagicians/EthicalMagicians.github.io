			My final project for my second semester in Bachelor of Creative Technologies (BCT).
			The concept behind this project was to investigate peoples attitudes to play through the different mediums of digital and physical.
			Two users could play a game of mini-golf against each other, one playing physically and one playing digitally.
			For this project I acted as the lead developer for the digital end of our digital-physical relationship.
			For full details regarding concept and development see the above link.
